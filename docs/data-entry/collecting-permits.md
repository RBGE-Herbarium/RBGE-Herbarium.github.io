The aim of the Permit Management System is to provide a central digital storage point for permit documentation relating to the biodiversity collections, both living and preserved. It will hold digital copies of Collecting, Export and Import Permits, MoUs, MTAs, Phytosanitary documentation, Plant Passports, Patens, Licenses, etc., along with some basic information, including restriction information for the documents.
