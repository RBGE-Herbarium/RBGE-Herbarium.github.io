# Taxon Form

Creating a record in the Taxon Form essentially creates the name as a nomenclatural element and does not include any taxonomic status for the name. Creating relationships between names with synonymy where you are building a taxonomic structure is done in the Taxon Tree (see Taxon Tree section further down for more information about how this works).


## To create a new Taxon record from the Collection Object form.

Before creating a new Taxon record, ensure that the name does not already exist.

Start typing the name in the Taxon box to see the drop down list of options

Use wildcards (%) to search names more easily

Also use wildcards (%) to check spelling variants or uncertainty

If it does not come up, then there is an option to do an additional search by clicking on the magnifying glass to the right of the Taxon field.

This will bring up a pop-up window where you can search for the Full Name or the Common Name. When searching use the following options:
- Caesalpinia - will bring up the record that has only the characters Caesalpinia in it, ie the genus record.
- Caesalpinia% - will bring up all the records that start with Caesalpinia
- “Caesalpinia a%” - will bring up all the records that start with Caesalpinia a, ie all the Caesalpinia species beginning with “a” (NB, using Caesalpnia a% without the quotation marks will bring up records starting with “A” and ignores the Caesalpinia text.

If you are sure that the name is not in the system, then a new taxon name can be created. Click the + button to open the Taxon form. Follow the Instructions for entering a new Taxon.



### To create a new Taxon record from the Taxon form directly.

Click on the Data Entry button on the main menu bar and select Taxon from the pop up. This will open the Taxon entry screen.



At any point, to save the record click Save in the bottom right of the screen. The Save and Add Another button saves the record and creates a duplicate - this should not generally be used at present.
