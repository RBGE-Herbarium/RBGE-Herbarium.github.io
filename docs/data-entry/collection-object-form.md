Select Collection Object from the pop up:

This opens the Collection Object entry screen

At any point, to save the record click Save in the bottom right of the screen. The Save and Add Another button saves the record and creates a duplicate - this should not generally be used at present.

Tip: If you are in a subform as a pop-up window, such as Preparations, then you will need to click Accept first to return to the Collection Object form to click Save.
