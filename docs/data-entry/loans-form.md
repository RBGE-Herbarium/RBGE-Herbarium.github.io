In Specify, an outgoing loan is treated as a Loan interaction. 


## Creating the Loan record and entering information about the loaned material 

There are several options for creating a record with the specimens to be loaned. Each user may want to use the method that works best for them and the loan in question. 

- Option 1: Create a record set of Collection Object records based on a query prior to creating the loan record. 
- Option 2: Create an empty loan record and add specimens either by entering preparations individually or by adding a record set as outline above. 
- Option 3: For large or complex loans, it may be better to use Specify6 where you will be able to select the preparations to be loaned by the barcode. 

This guidance will focus on Option 1 as the default. 

With the loaned material and request documentation at hand, open Specify7 to create a record set.

Use a Query to select the Collection Object records. This may be based on reading in a set of barcodes if you have the specimens at hand (see below) or by querying on a taxon or region

Example: E01035973, E01035943, E01035944, E01035945, E01035946, E01035947, E01035948, E01035949 

Save the results as a record set.

Click on Interactions and select Loan.

In the pop-up window, the record sets you have saved should be visible and available. If there are no record sets saved, you will not see this option. 

Select the appropriate record set for the loan.

You will now have the option to select the preparations for the loan. Since the query was carried out on Collection Objects, if there are multiple preparations for a single Collection Object you will see all the preparations in this list and will need to select the preparations going on loan.

Select the appropreate Preparations, or click Select all, then click Apply. 

This will open a Loan record with the preparations attached.

A pop-up window will give you the option of the document to print. Select Loan Packing List and click Ok 

A pdf document will be created containing a summary list of the specimens being loaned. This can be printed for inclusion with the shipment.

This can also be saved and added to the Loan record as an attachment. When saving the report a range of options is available, including PDF, docx and xlsx. Please use one of the agreed standards that are supported by RBGE.

To add the saved file as an attachment, go back into the Loan record and click on the Attachments icon.

Click New

Choose file and click New. 

There is an option to make the attachment private. This has not yet been explored. 

Click Done. 

If another report is required, click on the Reports button on the top menu. In this case, you will need the Loan number. 

In future the following reports will also be available: Outgoing Loan and Loan Recall. These can be created from the Reports menu on the left of the Specify window.  

Enter the Loan record number to bring up the relevant report. For a large loan, it may take a few minutes to create the report.  

## Recording receipt of the loan from the borrowing institute

Enter the following information:  

- **Date Received:** Enter the date the loan was received by the borrowing institute.   

  **N.B.** This date was not recorded previously, for loans migrated from BG-BASE the loan trans_dt was migrated into this field

- **Received Comments:** Enter any comments from the receiver of the loan.

## Recording an extension, if required

If an extension is requested and approved, open the Loan Record and update the Current Due Date to the new, agreed due date, leaving the Original Due Date unchanged.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6713716/176491038-34613c28-8e33-43a1-b3f5-0e32a800c0b2.png)

Tick the Extension Granted checkbox.

## Recording return of the loaned material

When specimens are returned from the borrowing institute, open the Loan Record and click on the Return Loan button at the bottom of the form.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6713716/176491291-7d6f3802-b50d-458a-90e5-386304201461.png)

Select the specimens being returned and click Apply. When you save the Loan record, the numbers in the Total Preps, Resolved Preps and Unresolved Preps will automatically update

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6713716/176491361-71712ae1-b82e-4b20-9794-5e4348f46e24.png)

If you did not select all the specimens to be returned, you should see that there will be some Unresolved Preps. These can be resolved by either adding them as a return at a later date, or by resolving them manually with a note.

## Recording return of the loaned material - althernative method

The above method works well when a full return has occurred.  if only a partial return is recieved, the below is recommended:
Perform a query to find the specimens that have been returned.  this can be done by way of the "Loaned Preparations (For Returning) Query: https://herb-rbge.specifycloud.org/specify/query/110/
Click query, and check that the items are as expected:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8005676/180250702-6b83c093-ab48-42f6-a32c-4c5ef9d77c2e.png)

then click "Return Loaned Items".  Note, this button will only appear if the query is returning Loan Preparation items (as this one does).

## Closing the loan

When all the specimens have been returned the Loan Record can be closed. Any specimens which will not be returned can be resolved. The Quantify Returned box should be left as 0, and the Quantity Resolved box should have a 1. A note can be included to explain the reason in the Description field for each appropriate specimen.  

- **Date Closed:** Enter the date on which the loan is closed.
