Record sets can be created and shared.

Note: Be aware that a shared record set that is deleted will be deleted for all users.

### How to create a new Record set

Use a query to find the records wanted.

In the Results view, make sure that some of the records have been selected, and click on the Create a Record Set button in the top right.
