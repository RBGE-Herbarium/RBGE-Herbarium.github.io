Record Sets can be created and shared.

Note: Be aware that a shared Record Set that is deleted will be deleted for all users.

## How to create a new Record Set

Use a query to find the records wanted.

In the Results view, make sure that some of the records have been selected, and click on the Create a Record Set button in the top right.

Click on the name of the Record Set created to open and browse the records. You will be asked if you are sure you want to leave the page. If you have finished the query, click Leave. Otherwise, click Cancel. Then right click the link to the Record set and open in a new tab.

## How to share a Record Set

When you have opened a Record Set you will be able to share the url with another Specify user. Be aware that if the person who created the Record Set then deletes it, it will be deleted for all users.
