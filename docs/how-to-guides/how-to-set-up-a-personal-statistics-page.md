## How to set up personal statistics page

The statistics page allows users to view institutional statistics (those for the whole collection) and personal statistics (unique to the user). The institutional statistics page is managed by the in-house Specify team, so whilst you cannot edit the statistics, you can view them and the data records associated with them. This guide will descrive how to set-up the personal statistics page.

Select the Personal tab in the Private section on the left hand side of the statistics page:

![personal page](https://github.com/RBGE-Herbarium/RBGE-Herbarium.github.io/assets/8155743/40551baa-a5f2-4c3e-90d4-02cfcd736016)

By default there is a single section in this view called Curation, with two default figures:

1. Collection Objects Cataloged - this is a count of all collection objects created by the user
2. Collection Objects Determined - this is a count of all determination records attributed to the user (based on their Specify account agent)

To add a new category, or additional statistics to an existing category, click edit at the top right of the screen

This changes the view to the edit screen

Here you can:

1. Add a new category
2. Delete a category
3. Add new statistics to a category
4. Delete statistics from a category

 ### Adding a new category

 To add a category click on the gray 'Add A Category' square:

This creates an empty category. Enter a name for the category in the bar at the top of the section:

### Deleting a category

To delete a category click on the 'Delete Category' button in the bottom left of the category box:

This will delete the category with no warnings to check that this is what you want to do.

### Adding statistics to a category

To add staistics to a new or existing category click the blue add button in the bottom right of a category

This will open your a list of saved queries. The top section of this list contains queries that you have saved to your account, at the bottom of the list is a section titled 'Select from Available Default Statistics', which includes queries to produce the default statistics that are included with the statistics page:

![image](https://github.com/RBGE-Herbarium/RBGE-Herbarium.github.io/assets/8155743/ba0d8d49-5fd9-407f-a344-8abadcd7ab37)

To select a default statistic just click on the one you would like to include. 

You can also use a previously saved query, to select one of these just click on the query you would like to use. 

Some queries that you may find useful are included here. You just need to save these to your account and edit the specified fields to personalise them to you:

* <a href="https://herb-rbge.specifycloud.org/specify/query/407/"> Created Last 7 days </a> 
* <a href="https://herb-rbge.specifycloud.org/specify/query/406/">Created Last Month </a> 
* <a href="https://herb-rbge.specifycloud.org/specify/query/405/">Created Last Year </a> 
* <a href="https://herb-rbge.specifycloud.org/specify/query/403/">Modified Last 7 days </a> 
* <a href="https://herb-rbge.specifycloud.org/specify/query/402/">Modified Last Month </a> 
* <a href="https://herb-rbge.specifycloud.org/specify/query/404/">Modified Last Year </a> 

For all of these you will need to add an agent id to personalise the results to yourself. To find your AgentID use the following <a href="https://herb-rbge.specifycloud.org/specify/query/408/">query</a>
Enter you last name and search. If there are multiple records for your name contact a member of the Specify team and we can provide you with the correct AgentId.

If you know what statistic you would like to include, but are not sure what query is needed to provide it, please contact a member of the Specify team and we will help you develop the query needed. 

As well as using saved queries, you can create a new query from the query pop up by selecting new in the bottom left. This works as the query builder normally does, by selecting a base table and then the fields you want to query on.

### Deleting statistics from a category

To delete a statistic from a category click the bin icon next to the statistic ![image](https://github.com/RBGE-Herbarium/RBGE-Herbarium.github.io/assets/8155743/f5b7d6b8-c167-4a8d-94cb-ad0827ef0fbe). This will delete the statistic without any warning. 

Default statistic can be added again from the default list of statistics.

### Saving your changes

Once you ahve made the edits you want to the statistics page, click on the save button in the top right of the screen:

## Interacting with the statistics page

It is possible to view the records associated with a particular statistic. To do this click on the name of the statistic, this will open a query tool pop up and automatically run the query.

The results of the query can be viewed as with any query by either browsing in forms or opening individual records in a new tab.
