## How to add information to the Statistics pages

Additional guidance at [Specify Discourse](https://discourse.specifysoftware.org/t/statistics-page/1135)

Specify has shared and private areas for Statistics pages. Each area can have multiple pages. The default shared page is called Collection and this will contain all the most commonly used statistics, including those for reporting. Adding too many statistics to this page may slow down the queries so we are using additional pages for more detailed information.
You can add as many pages and statistics to your personal pages.

All statistics are produced using a Query. For the Shared pages, these queries should be saved using a standard naming convention and ownership transferred to the Specify Admin account to ensure that they are not deleted by mistake or when a user's account is closed.

### Creating a new query from within the stats page:

- Repeat previous instructions to go to the Choose Statistics dialog
- Click New at the bottom left to show the query tables.
- Select a table and it will create a new empty query. If you click on close here, it will take you back to Choose Statistics dialog.
- Add fields and click on Save. It will create a statistic and return you to the Categories view in edit mode. Note that you cannot create a query without fields added.
- Once returned to the main view. Your new statistic will appear under the respective category as “New Query”. You can now change the name by editing the text field.
  - Use the following format for the name: "stats - clear description".
  - This name can be edited in the Statistics page to remove the word "stats" whilst keeping it in the query itself.
- Click Save in the top right to confirm the addition.
