A Collection Object is a way of bringing all the material collected from a single organism (or population) together under a shared entity, usually defined by the collector and collector number.

The Collection Object record contains all the information that is shared by all the material collected.

Each piece of material, or specimen, is then treated as a Preparation and only the information unique to each of these specimens (or which may differ) is recorded in the Preparation records.
